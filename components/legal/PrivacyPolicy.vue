      <h4 class="mb-4 font-bold text-xl">Security</h4>
      <p>
        We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit
        sensitive information via the website, your information is protected
        both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information (such
        as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to
        us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock
        icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the
        beginning of the address of the web page. <br />
        While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted
        online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who
        need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or
        customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable
        information. The computers/servers in which we store personally
        identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

      <h4 class="mb-4 font-bold text-xl">Registration</h4>
      <p>
        For effective use of this website, users are advised to complete the
        registration form. During registration a user is required to give
        certain information (such as name and email address). This information
        is used to contact you about the products/services on our site in which
        you have expressed interest. At your option, you may also provide

    <section class="mt-12">
      <h4 class="mb-4 font-bold text-xl">Cookies</h4>
      <p>
        We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a
        site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and
        identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie
        to identify you, depending on your browser settings you would not have
        to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our
        site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of
        our users to enhance the experience on our site. Usage of a cookie is in
        no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site.
        <br />
        Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example,
        advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these
        cookies.

    </section>
    <section class="mt-12">
      <h4 class="mb-4 font-bold text-xl">Sharing</h4>
      <p>
        We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and
        advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can
        identify any individual person. We use a credit card processing company
        to bill users for products and services. These companies do not retain,
        share, store or use personally identifiable information for any
        secondary purposes beyond fulfilling your order.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the
        user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact
        information that is necessary for the third party to provide these
        services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable
        information except for the purpose of providing these services.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Using the Exquisite Escape SIM card, mobile phone and tablet Apps (the
        "Mobile Apps")
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        When you use a Exquisite Escape SIM Card or Mobile App, we collect and
        use information about you in the same way and for the same purposes as
        we do when you use our website.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In addition to this, we also use some other information that we collect
        automatically when you use our Mobile Apps e.g. we collect information
        about Mobile App functionality that you access and use. This allows us
        to identify those areas of the Mobile App that are of interest to our
        customers so that we can refine and continuously improve the Mobile App.
        The information we collect for this purpose does not enable us to
        directly identify you. <br />When you use our Mobile App, you can choose
        to allow access to your current location – provided by your mobile
        device using GPS or similar technologies – in order to identify nearby
        hotels or airports. If you choose to allow access, this location data
        may be collected anonymously as part of search requests logged by our
        servers. You can switch off the Mobile App’s access to your location at
        any time through your phone settings menu. <br />Each Mobile App will
        also send us error-reporting information in the event that it crashes or
        hangs. This enables us to investigate the error and to improve the
        stability of the Mobile App for future releases. We do not use this
        information for any purpose other than investigating and remedying the
        error. <br />You always have the ability to control what information a
        Mobile App sends to us. You can exercise this control either by changing
        the settings of the Mobile App under its setting menu or changing the
        settings of your mobile device. Alternatively, you can remove the Mobile
        App from your mobile device entirely and access our services through our
        website.
